    <p>&emsp;&emsp;HELLO THERE! I am currently a software developer and a (soon to be) graduate of Rutgers University with a BS in Information Technology and a minor in Computer Science.</p>
    <br>
    <p markdown="1">&emsp;&emsp;A little bit about my schooling (since many ask what's the difference between IT and Computer Science), my Computer Science curriculum is comprised of numerous technical courses such as Systems Programming, Data Structures and Algorithms, Computer Architecture, Systems as well as Operating Systems. On the Information Technology side, I have taken courses in Web Design as well as networking, internet technologies and e-commerce. These courses have built up my knowledge and understanding of the various disciplines in the industry as a whole and offered me a chance to work in a variety of languages, frameworks and tools (_see resume_).</p>
    <br>
    <p>&emsp;&emsp;I'm interested and intrigued by a several of the unique fields in the tech field and I don't feel like restricting myself to a single field within the industry. I don't really have too much preference on which specific discipline I go into at the moment so I'm doing my best to get a working and occasionally in depth knowledge of the following fields</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Front-end Web Development</li>
        <li>Back-end Application Development</li>
        <li>Data Science (specifically information retrieval methods)</li>
        <li>Embedded Systems Development (Mostly microcontrollers)</li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <p>&emsp;&emsp;The purpose of this blog is to post updates on any projects, books and developments in the industry. I see this as a good way for me to commit to tasks I start, since I have a habit of abandoning projects prematurely. To anyone interested my resume (pdf) is linked below and my github holds most of my projects</p>

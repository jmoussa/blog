### School
Things are kicking into (kind of) high gear now. After midterms almost all my classes released the final assignment/projects that we are to spend the rest of the semester on. I'm excited about almost all of them, *cough15pageresearchpapercough*. Regardless I feel like I'll actually enjoy learning about most of them, it's just starting that paper is going to be a nightmare (note: I feel this is the root of my procrastination in this class specifically).

#### Ineffective Professor Rant Follow Up
Aside from getting a ton of assignments to keep me busy for the rest of the semester, I have also decided to take some action against my ineffective Database Tech instructor (see WTF_RANT.c post for details). I sent an email earlier last week and got a reply from the head of the IT department and I got an appointment to come in and talk about it. I really had no gameplan in terms of what I wanted to happen. I didn't really find it feasable for them to remove the instructor since finding a new one mid-semester would be even harder. I just felt they deserved to know about what's going on in their department and that the students don't like to deal with this BS (pardon my french). What is really sad is that everyone in my class agrees upon the fact that they were not learning or taking away anything from the class, and that pisses me off to no end, especially if we're the ones paying them to teach us.


### Personal
I've started to slow down with my personal project (using react, express, mysql) since my schoolwork seems to have been picking up more than usual. I'm still tweaking things here and there, but I haven't been on a 4 hour coding binge for over 2 weeks now. I kind of miss it, but then remember I got nothing done (school work wise) the last time I did that, so a little moderation is definitely welcome. I'm hoping to work more on it and get some actual page layouts finished this weekend though.

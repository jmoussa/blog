### Settling In

Trying to maintain stability in my daily life now. I can feel myself slowly settling into the routine of my classes, work and personal projects. I recently started whiteboarding my agenda an I feel that's a great contibutor to this. I have a chart for my classes, their assignments and the due date. Below the chart I have a list of personal projects which I'm saving for the weekends and my objectives for the next day. This started as an afterthought but I'm seeing myself always going back to it so I might keep up with it and throw it into the routine.


### Minimal Effort

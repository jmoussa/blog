I think I've gotten my Expense Report App to an acceptable state, and I'm beginning to look into how I can deploy it.
One feature I might have to do is create a login and user system since each user would be able to manage their own expenses. The more I look into it the larger it seems, so I will see if there's a way to avoid that, although keeping a public ledger of all expenses, is not ideal.

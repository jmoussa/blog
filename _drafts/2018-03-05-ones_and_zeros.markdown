### School
Despite it being midterm season, I seem to be staying very calm and relatively on top of all my tasks. I'm also appearing to be doing well in all my classes so I don't see a reason to panic, or stress about exams. Surprisingly enough I'm stressing about my personal projects which I really shouldn't be at this current point in time.



The inept 'professor' hasn't really changed much, however we're focusing more on our final projects during class now so she doesn't really have much to do other than check on us. Not really much you can screw up there, right? Kinda, any question we ask usually merits a series of contradictory answers that don't end up answering our original question so we're forced to rephrase it into a simple yes/no question instead of asking for clarification in an open ended format.

### Personal
My personal projects seem to be going well. Still brainstorming for my Alexa app, my React/Node/MySQL site has pivoted to become a part of my database class's final project. I think it's for the best since I was just doing a basic template with some arbitrary features and no real goal. This new path is definitely helpful for my learning ReactJS and Databases.

### RANT: The Problem with Bootcamps (with TL;DR)
So if you ever go on the Internet, and have a slight interest in technology you will see all these 'coding bootcamps' advertised to you telling you that you will 'become a web developer in x months' or 'learn to be a software engineer in y months'. For the most part, the ones that promise you a general profession in a few months are almost always exaggerating it greatly. Unless the companies offering them are Google, Facebook etc. you won't likely be able to get a job right out of the camp. What you *will* be able to do is develop your skills to a point where you can further learn more about the industry and be able to at least start your own projects. From there, you will increase your likelihood of attaining a job in that role.



I am not necessarily knocking coding bootcamps, I think they are very valuable alternative to a 4 year college degree from the technical aspect. You will definitely learn a lot of useful material needed to get started in the industry. I personally don't think that you will be able to enter with no experience in the industry and then in 6 months (or less) be able to walk out and get a job the next day. The bootcamp simply gives you the basic and necessary skills needed for the industry, from there you have to go off a cultivate them further before people will consider hiring you. 



I feel that's the same to a certain degree with 4 year computer science degrees, you'll have some projects you worked on in school that might actually get your foot in the door but won't be too relevant to your first position (in my case they weren't too relevant). For the most part though, you will have to spend some time further enhancing your skills, you can't just attend all your classes and do well and get a degree anymore, that's just the bare minimum. In my case, none of my classes touched upon some basic administrative things or tools that were a necessity in the industry, I had to go out and research them and how to use them on my own. The same thing applies for bootcamps, they cant teach you all that in just 6 months, they can give you the barebones essentials that you can't get by yourself (easily). That's why they're great for people who are coming from a completely different field to get caught up and have a decent foundation.



#### TL;DR
Bootcamps promise a career when all they give is a foundation for a career, you have to further cultivate your skills gained from them in order to actually get a job. Not saying they're bad at all, just misrepresented.

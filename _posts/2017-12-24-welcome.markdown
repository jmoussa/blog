So this is my first post, so I'll just give a rundown of my life up to this point and what I plan on doing with this blog. :)

### Job / Career
As of now, I am employed at AT&T Labs as a Student Intern and I'm probably going to be "promoted" to a contractor after I graduate Rutgers in the spring. Unless I find another job. I'm definitely enjoying my time there, it's a great environment and the projects span across various small disciplines in sotware development.

### Personal Life
Most of my life involves reading books about programming and programming practices, or the "self-help" non-fiction type of books. Currently I'm actively reading Mark Manson's The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F*ck, and I must say it has been a joy to read and learn from. I'm also in the middle of reading a couple other books that I'll list at the end of this post, all of them are programming/development oriented. Besides reading, I enjoy taking up personal projects here and there, currently I am between projects so there's no real update on that other than this blog of course. This blog is a project in and of itself and has taught me how to manipulate Jekyll to create and modify it. 


This blog is also my way of keeping track of all my projects and organizing them so that nothing gets out of hand since I have a habit of starting a bunch of different projects and dropping off some to return (or not return) to later on. I don't know how often I will be posting, just depends on what I have to say and how urgent it is. I'll start out modestly at once a week and go from there. Hopefully after a month I will have a decent idea of what my blogging schedule will be like and will update that in the *About Me* page.

### Work

This is awkward. It's pretty much a given (for me) that I'm leaving my current company and I already have an offer from another. 
What's awkward is coming in to work, and not doing anything or telling anyone because the deal isn't solidified yet.

UPDATE: 5/23

The deal has been solidified. I just put in my two weeks and my new position should start mid-June. 
My current manager was very understanding and I've also agreed to help him find my replacement as well as clean up all my projects in the coming days.

### Personal

I've been riding my motorcycle more and more, it's great because I always learn something new or at least gain comfortability the more I ride.
I just got a GoPro so I can at least look back at my rides. 
I still need an external mic if I want to talk (without the wind/engine getting in the way).
For now, it's good to look back and reflect on my rides and riding to see what I can improve.

I've also began looking into 3D Printing at the makerspace offered by Rutgers. 
It's a little intimidating at first but once you get into, it's not too difficult.

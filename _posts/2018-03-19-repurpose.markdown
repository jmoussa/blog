### School

Spring break has just ended and I'm offically ready to get back and grind out the end of the semester. I didn't really get much done in terms of school work, if anything I didn't want or really need to. I felt that this break was really good in the fact that I didn't push myself, or overreach in terms of productivity. I just took a long needed rest to recharge and now I that I'm "productivity-deprived" I'm ready to get back in there and crank out some results.

### Personal
So as far as personal projects go, I finally started visualizations on my expense report web application. It took a little longer than expected since I had to basically restructure my database schema because of changing "business requirments" but I'm very happy with the direction it's going. I also only really spent one day on that, afterwards I would go on to not really worry about it since I'm pretty far ahead in implememntation and still trying to match this project with the database administration class project. I would like to keep the progress on both of them relatively even (so I don't have to go back and do something tedious like rewrite the schema and have a new form to include in the front and back end). Overall, this past week was a good relaxation period and nice mental break, now to buckle down and get back to the grind.

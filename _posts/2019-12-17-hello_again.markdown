It has been a while I must admit. 2019 has been quite the ride for me from a personal and professional view as well. So much to talk about.

### Job / Career
This is probably the biggest life change but it doesn't seem like that now since it happened so long ago.
As of February I left my position as a Salesforce Developer at Internet Creations and went on to work at my current company, Genomic Prediction. 
It was a good change since I didn't like the consulting scene and wasn't particularly fond of Salesforce development. 
I am happily employed as a software developer (specifically backend developer) and I get to work on a completely new tech stack (Node.js, Express, MySQL, Python, Docker, AWS).
So since I am one of few developers in this company I've had to invest more into my personal learning which I love, and I've had to take on more responsibilities when it came to DevOps.
I'm still getting the hang of this whole DevOps thing but I'm finding joy in automating a bunch of the tasks I usually find tedious so there's clearly a lot to gain there.
I'm also enjoying a more cognitive role as I am constructing databases and backend systems from the ground up and I'm seeing first hand the need for many of the industry practices we put in play (mainly security).

### Personal Life
My personal life has also been a ride. 
In May I finally moved out of my parents place and into a 4 bedroom house in Piscataway with some of my long time friends from high school/college, so that has been quite an adventure.

I've also financed a motorcycle (I know, worst decision of my life) and it's been very much worth it.

I went to a bunch of new places, Montreal for a guys trip, Southern California (San Diego, Anahiem, Los Angeles) with the family.
Took a 3 day trip to the Poconos with some friends and did some hiking, which is when I realized how out of shape I am.

Speaking of out of shape, I finally realized I have to start taking care of myself more. I guess that comes with the moving-out part.
I'm still getting the hang of this whole eating clean thing, but I've been pretty good about doing for a couple months, with the occassional necessary relapse because Thanksgiving.

#### I've kind of stopped reading and started working on personal projects so here's a list of the personal projects that I've been working on:

+ Udemy course for Java Spring (I'd like to get back in the OOP side of things because functional and procedural are not everything)
+ Consulting for a very early stage startup in the Veterinary Tech space
+ Creating a ticket tracking app using Java Spring and React+Redux on the front-end (probably been put on hold since I started getting serious about learning the Spring framework)


#### I've also started making a travel list of places that I could go to, mainly solo trips

+ San Diego / SoCal 
+ San Francisco
+ Colorado
+ Montreal (Should probably brush up on my french this thime)
+ Iceland
+ England
+ Ohio (for WGI championships, also want to try a long motorcycle trip)
